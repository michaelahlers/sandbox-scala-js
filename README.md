# Sandbox: Scala.js

Learning and exploring usage of Scala.js.

## Disclaimer

This is project is very much a work-in-progress, and isn't yet ready to serve as any kind of a guide. Eventually, it'll offer a few interesting concepts complimentary to other tutorials. See [Scala.js Single Page Application Tutorial](https://github.com/ochrons/scalajs-spa-tutorial) by [Otto Chrons](https://github.com/ochrons) for an excellent illustration of how to build complex Scala.js applications.
